## Hi there!👋

Welcome to my Github page! I'm Kathy Zeleke.

I'd like to describe myself as an aspiring technical writer passionate about learning all things technical. Here are somethings to know about me:

- I'm looking forward to contributing to open source documentation here on GitHub.
- I enjoy learning new skills such as ethical hacking, just for fun!
- Along with technical writing, I also enjoy reflective, inspirational blogging on Medium (https://medium.com/@LifeReloaded).
- Fun fact: During my 3-year stint at Deloitte, I contributed to the markup and content of a Knowledge Management Repository for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

If any of this sounds interesting to you. Please feel free to follow me on LinkedIn or reach out via LinkedIn.
